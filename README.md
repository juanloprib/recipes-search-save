Testing the Yummly API with JavaScript using MVC. Everything was coded by me, without frameworks or libraries, only the API and vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML. I also designed it.

Some features of the app:
1.	You can search for recipes and display a maximum of 12 results.
2.	You can save recipes using LocalStorage.
3.	I added a loading screen with a CSS animation of a fork. because the API can take some time to respond.
4.	If no image is available, the app shows a generic image.
